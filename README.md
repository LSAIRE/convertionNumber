# This Project ReactJS

13 Write in your language of choice a function that converts a roman
number string to an integer. Make sure to build it in a way that will be
future proof to new specifications without adding unnecessary
complexity. Also make sure it is clean and easy to understand for
another developer.
The following symbols represent the values.
I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000
Each character adds a number. However, those are the exceptions :
I can be before V and X to be 4 and 9
X can be before L and C to be 40 and 90
C can be before D and M to be 400 and 900
Example 1: XXI is 21
Example 2: XL is 40
Example 3: LVIII is 58
The code can be written within an editor and sent by email in a ZIP.
14 Write unit tests that make sure the function from the previous
question is working properly. Make sure to have 100% test coverage
and include all possible test cases. Include it in the same ZIP.
